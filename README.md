# Overview

BUILDSbot 12 Ounce is part of the overarching BUILDSbot project. The goal is to create a functional robot which can take commands from a USB serial connection (possibly move to a wireless connection eventually). The robot should also be capable of doing line following as its main function. USB connectivity is simply for testing and possibly to help simplify future wireless based communication schemes.

# Specifications and Goals

* Tiny, lightweight and easy to make.
* Takes commands over USB.
* Line Following
* Motor adjustments to drive in a true straight line
